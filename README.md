# Set Generation

10000 littlebits set creation algorithm and tools.

* Algorithm is commited ahead of time.
* A future block is chosen and is publicly announced.
* That blocks hash is used as seed to generate the entire set.
* This ensures randomness and unpredictability in the set generation process
